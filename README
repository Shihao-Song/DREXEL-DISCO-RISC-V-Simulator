A simple but cycle-accurate RISC-V simulator designed by Drexel DISCO Lab

P.I.s: Dr. Anup Das, Dr. Nagarajan Kandasamy

Course Projects Based on DREXEL-DISCO-RISC-V-Simulator:
(1) Single-cycle RISC-V Simulation with Exploration to Multi-core System
(2) Pipelining RISC-V Simulation with Data Forwarding

To compile:
bash compile.bash single-cycle OR
bash compile.bash pipeline

To run:
./RVSim configs/RISC_V.cfg out/out cpu_traces/traces_for_core_0 cpu_traces/traces_for_core_1 <...>
